# Premise:
The team I was working with needed a way to keep track of topic suggestions for
internal technical development. I decided that a fun way might be to create a simple
voting system where the stats updated in realtime across open browsers.

# Tech Features:
JS/HTML/CSS Frontent
NodeJS Server/Backend
Neo4j Graph Database as the DB
Proxmox LXC Container
Anisible System Deployment
Google OAuth2 login integration
