-- Planned --
Automate the following during creation
  create .well-known/acme-challenge directory
  install certbot
  copy over /usr/certbot directory
  setup sym links to certs to target directory
  (all of this for automatic auto renew with certbot renew)

  Maybe just run create a script that runs:
   certbot certonly --webroot -w /openvote/dist/ -d techvote.jakecallery.com
   copy /etc/letsencrypt/live/techvote.jakecallery.com/privkey.pem to /openvote/Server/Certs/privkey.pem
   copy /etc/letsencrypt/live/techvote.jakecallery.com/chain.pem to /openvote/Server/Certs/chain.pem
   copy /etc/letsencrypt/live/techvote.jakecallery.com/fullchain.pem to /openvote/Server/Certs/fullchain.pem


change root password for app node during deployment
start pm2 as a "safe" user

Create Constraints on DB (no duplicate topic/vote id's etc..)

SSL Cert auto renew
Nightly Backups (more than just nightly snapshot)

Catch stale cookie during api call and refresh to login page

-- Low Priority --
